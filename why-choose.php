                                    Quick Logistics is not exempt! There are so many parties involved in international freight shipping from shipping handlers to freight forwarders to customs agents you need to be sure that every piece of the puzzle is accurately in place to ensure that the shipment is both time and cost effective.</p>

                                    <p>The service industry is a very complex environment. Most of us not only strive to provide the best service possible, it is integrated in our business model as a core component of our business. Providing a consistent professional service and staying agile is a must in order stay competitive. There should be zero room for being complacent. Despite our best efforts, clients will be displeased from time to time. Simply accepting ongoing dissatisfaction as an inevitable part of doing business is bad practice and can have serious negative repercussion. Instead, work at improving how you deal with customers whose experience has been less than satisfactory. It could mean the difference between losing customers permanently or keeping them satisfied – maybe even more committed to doing business with you.</p>
